Question 1.
First, it creates a directory in the same folder called "os", with 0755 permissions.
Then, it creates a subfolder in "os" called "2015".
Then, it opens a handler to a file "info" with permissions to write only, if it doesn't exists it creates it,
and truncates it if it exists ("w"), and receives a file descriptor from the OS.
It then calls fstat with the given file descriptor, as a regular file with 0644 permissions. it's empty.
We allocate 2^16 bytes of memory. We write to the file a lot of spaces (110), then the username
	of the current logged in user, and then the parameter given to the program.
It then de-allocates the memory allocated, and deletes the file and all directories created.
(os/2015/info, os/2015/, os/),
and then calls exit with status 0 (success).
